Home and Contributor page with background image.
Now, user can select some fruits in the shopping page and save that into App's state. We can see the selected items in the selected item box.
Next time, we will get the total number and price of selected fruits from App's state values.

Goals of this project :
1) Using 'react-router-dom' package, make the each large single script to divided into simple scripts.
2) With javascript codes, load selected item when the page reloaded by saving the seleceted item into local storage.
3) When user scrolls down the page, which directory is the homepage('/'), background image will be blurred by CSS.
